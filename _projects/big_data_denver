#### Introduction
# Urban Greenspace and Asthma Prevalence

This project examines the link between vegitation cover (using average NDVI as a measurement of vegatation health) and human health. In this notebooke I will calucalte patch, edge, and fragmentation statistics about urban greenspace in Washington D.C. These statistics should be reflective of the connectivity and spread of urban greenspace, which are important for ecosystem function and access. I then use a inear model to identify statistically significant correlations between the distribution of greenspace and health data compiled by the US Center for Disease Control.

## Using 'Big Data' in the Form of Census Tracts

For this project, I split up the green space (NDVI) data by census tract, because this matches the human health data from the CDC. Because I need to know more about the structure of green space within each tract, I need higher resolution data, so I will use National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data, which is taken for the continental US every few years at 1m resolution. The main purpose of the NAIP data is, as the name suggests, agriculture. However, itâ€™s also a great source for urban areas where lots is happening on a very small scale.

### Set Up Analysis

# Imports

```python

import pandas as pd
import rioxarray as rxr # Work with geospatial raster data
import geopandas as gpd
import pathlib
import os
import hvplot.pandas
import geoviews as gv
import cartopy.crs as ccrs
gv.extension('bokeh')  # Activates GeoViews with the Bokeh backend

# For the NDVI Data
import re # Extract metadata from file names
import zipfile # Work with zip files
from io import BytesIO # Stream binary (zip) files
import numpy as np # Unpack bit-wise Fmask
import requests # Request data over HTTP
import pystac_client
import rioxarray.merge as rxrmerge
import shapely
import xarray as xr
import glob
from cartopy import crs as ccrs
from scipy.ndimage import convolve
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from scipy.ndimage import label
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm

warnings.simplefilter('ignore')
```

```python
# Prevent GDAL from quitting due to momentary disruptions
os.environ["GDAL_HTTP_MAX_RETRY"] = "5"
os.environ["GDAL_HTTP_RETRY_DELAY"] = "1"
```

## STEP 2: Create a Site Map

Use the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Places dataset for human health data to compare with vegetation. CDC Places also provides
some modified census tracts, clipped to the city boundary, to go along with the health data. Start by downloading the matching geographic
data, and then select the City of Denver, Colorado.

```python
# Define info for CDC download, and only download cdc data once
if not os.path.exists(cdc_data_path):
    cdc_data_url = ('https://data.cdc.gov/download/x7zy-2xmx/application%2Fzip')
    cdc_data_gdf = gpd.read_file(cdc_data_url)
    denver_gdf = cdc_data_gdf[cdc_data_gdf.PlaceName=='Denver']
    denver_gdf.to_file(cdc_data_path, index=False)

# Load in cdc data
denver_gdf = gpd.read_file(cdc_data_path)

# Check the data - site plot 
denver_gdf.plot()

(
    denver_gdf
    .to_crs(ccrs.Mercator())
    .hvplot(
        line_color='red', fill_color=None,
        crs=ccrs.Mercator(), tiles='EsriImagery',
        frame_width=600
    )
)
```
